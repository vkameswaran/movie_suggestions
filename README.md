# movie_suggestions

This is a series of short Python scripts I wrote in the summer of 2020 to add some useful functionality to a movie dataset I found online. Among the functions I wrote are:
- `find_movie_by_director`
- `search`
- `find_similar_movies`

## Getting Started

1. Download/clone this repository
2. Install requirements, with e.g. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. `python3 main.py`

## Sample output

```
Enter a movie name: Inception

Movies similar to Inception :
1. The Dark Knight Rises
2. The Dark Knight
3. Batman Begins
4. Interstellar
5. The Prestige
```
